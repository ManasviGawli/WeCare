    <p>Maintaining good eye health is crucial for preventing vision problems. Here are some helpful tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular Eye Exams:</strong> Schedule regular check-ups with your eye care professional to detect any early signs of eye conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the 20-20-20 Rule:</strong> Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eye strain from screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Wear Sunglasses:</strong> Protect your eyes from harmful UV rays by wearing sunglasses that block 100% of UV light.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat a Healthy Diet:</strong> Include foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E (e.g., carrots, leafy greens, and citrus fruits) to support eye health.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water to prevent dry eyes and help maintain good overall health.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Screen Time:</strong> Take regular breaks from screens to reduce digital eye strain and give your eyes time to rest.</li>

    <h2>Common Eye Conditions</h2>
    <p>There are several common eye conditions that affect many people. Understanding these can help you identify early signs and seek treatment:</p>
    <div class="conditions">
        <h3>1. Nearsightedness (Myopia)</h3>
        <p>This condition causes distant objects to appear blurry. It is often corrected with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Farsightedness (Hyperopia)</h3>
        <p>People with hyperopia can see distant objects clearly but have difficulty focusing on close objects. Glasses or contact lenses can help correct this condition.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Astigmatism</h3>
        <p>A common refractive error caused by an irregularly shaped cornea, leading to blurred vision. It can be corrected with glasses, contacts, or surgery.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Cataracts</h3>
        <p>Cataracts cause clouding of the eye's natural lens, leading to blurred vision. Surgery is often required to remove cataracts and restore vision.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Glaucoma</h3>
        <p>Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve, often due to high eye pressure. It can result in vision loss if left untreated.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Macular Degeneration</h3>
        <p>This age-related condition affects the central part of the retina (macula) and can cause loss of central vision.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Dry Eyes</h3>
        <p>Dry eyes occur when the eyes do not produce enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. Symptoms include irritation, redness, and a gritty sensation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Vision Safety Tips</h2>
    <p>Taking the proper precautions can protect your eyes from injury and preserve your vision:</p>

        <li><strong>Use Proper Lighting:</strong> Ensure your work or reading area is well-lit to reduce strain on your eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Take Breaks:</strong> Follow the 20-20-20 rule to rest your eyes, especially if you're working long hours on a computer.</li>
